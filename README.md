# Credit Card Default Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the default of credit card holders. The models used are logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifier, and decision tree classifier. The model will be trained on a dataset containing information about credit card holders and their previous payment history. It will then be used to predict the likelihood of a credit card holder defaulting on their payment in the future.

##  Data

The data used in this project is a credit card default dataset which contains information about 30,000 credit card holders. It contains information about customers' credit card usage, such as their credit limit, payment history ,etc.

## Models
The following machine learning models were built and evaluated in this project:

    * Logistic Regression
    * Naive Bayes Classifier
    * Decision Tree Classifier

## Evaluation
The performance of each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance. 

    * Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model in correctly predicting defaulters and non-defaulters
    * Precison: How often does the model anticipate default correctly?
    * Recall: The proportion of actual defaulters that the model will correctly predict as such.

# Conclusion

The results of this project demonstrate the usefulness of machine learning for credit card default prediction. By using logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifier, and decision tree classifier, we were able to build models that accurately predicted credit card default. The comparison of the models using confusion matrices provided valuable insights into the performance of each model and allowed us to choose the best performing model for this problem.
