## Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the default of credit card holders. The models used are logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifier, and decision tree classifier. The model will be trained on a dataset containing information about credit card holders and their previous payment history. It will then be used to predict the likelihood of a credit card holder defaulting on their payment in the future.

##  Data

The data used in this project is a credit card default dataset which contains information about 30,000 credit card holders. It contains information about customers' credit card usage, such as their credit limit, payment history ,etc.

## Models
The following machine learning models were built and evaluated in this project:

    * Logistic Regression
    * Naive Bayes Classifier
    * Decision Tree Classifier

## Evaluation
The performance of each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance. 

    * Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model in correctly predicting defaulters and non-defaulters
    * Precison: How often does the model anticipate default correctly?
    * Recall: The proportion of actual defaulters that the model will correctly predict as such.

# Conclusion

      * The goal of this project was to use Machine Learning Classification to predict credit card default, with a focus on getting a model which has achieved high accuracy.
      * The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the performance of the models, with accuracy, precision and recall being the key metrics.
      * Logistic regression had the highest accuracy among the three models, but had room for improvement in precision and recall.
      * Naive Bayes had the highest recall, but low precision.
      * Decision Tree had an average performance in terms of accuracy, precision and recall.
      * After model improvement, the recall and precision of the Logistic Regression model also increased, indicating a better ability to predict defaulters.
      * The final conclusion is that the models had some success in predicting credit card default, but there is still room for further improvement. Further analysis and adjustments can be done to achieve better results.
